# Changelog

## [0.6.23-dsh.20260926.1] - 2026-09-26

- Uses the upstream adapter manager, account views, diagnostics, same-origin read checks, settings revisions, and expanded credential redaction.
- Preserves namespaced providers, Claude probe filtering, committed settings snapshots, bounded retries, and V4 tool-history translation.
- Keeps Antigravity client secrets and restores unchanged masked credentials when saving settings.

Notable changes to `@goodandready/dsh-subscriptions`.

## 0.6.23

### Security & Privacy
- **Credential Redaction in Public Config (#242, #252)**: redacted nested proxy URL credentials (`user:••••••@host`) and custom vendor credentials (`apiKey`, `token`, `secret`, `headers.Authorization`) in `publicConfig`; dropped `antigravityClientSecret` from Config schema.
- **Fail-Closed Origin Validation (#341, #374)**: made `isTrustedSettingsRequest` fail-closed against absent origin headers on non-loopback clients; added 403 protection to `GET /config`, `GET /diagnostics`, and `GET /discover-local`.

### Reliability & Concurrency
- **Optimistic Concurrency on Config PUT (#379)**: added revision counter and CAS conflict detection on `PUT /config` returning 409 Conflict when saving from stale client revisions, with automatic draft reload in settings UI.
- **Bounded History & Clean Teardown (#377, #378)**: capped in-memory request `HistoryStore` to 1000 entries with eviction, added `dispose()` method hooked to `ctx.on('dispose')`; effect-bound client settings slots for proper teardown.

### UI & Theme Standards
- **DSH Theme Tokens Migration (#320)**: converted all standalone `rgba(...)` and hex colors in `lib/client.js` to canonical DSH theme tokens (`var(--dsw-alias-state-*)`, `var(--dsw-alias-bg-*)`, `var(--dsw-alias-brand-primary)`), ensuring crisp readability across both light and dark themes.

### Technical Debt & Packaging
- **Modularization & Linter Zero-Debt (#372)**: reduced `lib/index.js` from 861 lines to 415 lines by extracting `lib/adapter-manager.js`, `lib/diagnostics.js`, and `lib/accounts-view.js`; eliminated all 40 linter warnings (`no-unused-vars` enabled as error); wired `healthBadge` into account models and UI; added production route `DELETE /alerts`.
- **Localized Documentation Packaging (#375)**: included `README.ru.md` and `README.zh.md` in `package.json` `files` array for distribution on npm.

## 0.6.22

### Security
- **Cross-site Protection on Read Routes (#371)**: added `isTrustedSettingsRequest(req)` origin check returning 403 Forbidden for cross-site requests (`sec-fetch-site: cross-site`, cross-origin `Origin`/`Referer`) on read endpoints:
  - `GET /dsh-subscriptions/status`
  - `GET /dsh-subscriptions/history`
  - `GET /dsh-subscriptions/telemetry`
  - `GET /dsh-subscriptions/alerts`
  - `GET /dsh-subscriptions/reset-credits`
  Added regression tests in `test/routes-security.test.mjs` covering cross-site rejection and same-origin acceptance.

## 0.6.21

### Bug Fixes
- **Codex Tool Output HTTP 400 Repair (#369)**: mapped messages with `role: "tool"` to `function_call_output` in `codexResponsesBody`, added bidirectional reconciliation for OpenAI Responses protocol (synthesizing outputs for interrupted tool calls and dropping orphan outputs) to prevent vendor 400 errors.
- **Account Proxy Support in `listModels` (#369)**: passed account proxy fetch dispatcher via `pickFetch(this.deps, targetAccount.ref)` in `SubscriptionAdapter.prototype.listModels`, enabling live catalog fetching from geo-blocked regions.
- **Catalog Freshness (#369)**: updated default model list with modern models including GPT-5.6 Luna, GPT-5.3 Codex, and GPT-5.2 Codex.

## 0.6.20

### Performance
- **Immutable Config Snapshot & Hot Path Optimization (#367)**: eliminated expensive `scope.get()` and `structuredClone()` calls from hot request paths and loops, caching an immutable config snapshot invalidated only via `settings/document-updated` or explicit mutation; read config once per operation in `lib/accounts.js`.

## 0.6.19

### Security
- **Cross-site protection on POST /smoke (#359)**: added `isTrustedSettingsRequest(req)` guard to `/smoke` endpoint returning 403 Forbidden for cross-site callers, preventing unauthorized token refreshes and quota consumption.

## 0.6.18

### Security & Hardening
- **Strict Vault Schema & Injection Defense (#360)**: Vault imports now validate declared slot providers, non-negative integer indices, duplicate slots, and strictly reject undeclared credential blob injection.
- **Cascading Fallback Cycle Prevention & Abort Safety (#361)**: Added `visited` tracking set across cascade chains to eliminate infinite loops and `options.signal.aborted` checks to abort cascading when client cancels.
- **Auto-Reconciliation of Orphaned Slots (#362)**: `reconcileSlots` synchronizes discovered provider credentials directly from `ctx.credentials.describe`.
- **Adapter Lifecycle & Timer Teardown (#363)**: Added `adapterDisposed` guard to teardown retry timers and ignore sync tasks after adapter destruction.
- **Health Matrix i18n & UI Localization (#364)**: Localized Health Matrix column headers, health status badges, and plugin item title using `t()` across EN and ZH locales.

## 0.6.17

### Added
- **Cascading Cross-Vendor Fallback (#349)**: Seamless fallback across compatible providers (Claude -> Copilot -> Cursor) when accounts are exhausted or rate limited (opt-in via `cascadingFallback`).
- **Self-Healing Quarantine Warm-up (#350)**: Background warmup probe (`probing` status) verifies expired quarantine slots via `fetchForRef()` before returning to active pool, with exponential backoff on repeated failure.
- **Proactive Quota Alerts & Webhooks (#351)**: Threshold alerts (80%, 90%, 95%) and session expiration notifications with in-memory buffer, `/alerts` endpoint, and async HTTP POST webhook dispatch.
- **Predictive Burn-rate Optimizer & Auto-Pacing (#352)**: Runway calculation and exhaustion risk scoring in `pickAccount()` to dynamically balance token consumption until the quota reset window.
- **Encrypted Vault Export & Import (#353)**: AES-256-GCM encrypted backup and restore for slots and credential blobs via `/vault/export` and `/vault/import`.
- **Health Matrix Overview in UI (#354)**: Real-time health matrix showing latency, health scores, quarantine state, and quota runways in the plugin settings component.
- **Device-Flow OAuth Support (#355)**: Unified device-code authorization endpoints for Copilot and Codex with interactive polling.

## 0.6.16

### Performance & Security Optimization
- **Non-blocking stream initialization (#339)**: `refreshUsage` no longer delays Time To First Chunk (TTFT) by running sequentially before chunks are yielded; it now refreshes asynchronously in the background.
- **Debounced history persistence (#340)**: `HistoryStore` now buffers disk writes with a 1000ms debounce instead of synchronous `writeFileSync` on every completed request.
- **CSRF protection hardening (#341)**: `isTrustedSettingsRequest` now strictly validates `Host` vs `Origin` / `Referer` headers when `sec-fetch-site` is omitted.
- **Smart rotation health weighting (#342)**: `listAccounts` now computes and forwards `healthScore`, re-enabling penalty-aware rotation across account pools.
- **Proxy support for status and smoke checks (#343)**: Background health probes and `/check`, `/smoke` routes now route through the slot's configured `proxyUrl`.
- **GitHub Copilot Device Flow support (#344)**: Connected `deviceStart`, `devicePoll`, and `refresh` to the OAuth route handler, enabling Web UI Copilot authorization.
- **Public exports for forecast and relative time (#345)**: Exported `observeForecast`, `estimateForecast`, and `formatRelativeReset` from root `lib/index.js`.
- **Parallel slot reconciliation (#346)**: Cold-start slot discovery across 160 provider/index combinations now executes in parallel via `Promise.all`.
- **Memory leak prevention (#347)**: Implemented automatic pruning of expired entries in `sessionPins` and reset-credit `challenges`.

## 0.6.15

### Fixed
- **Settings reachable again on the plugin's own page**: the current DSH core
  (0.1.6-alpha.2) renders a plugin's configuration page only for entries registered
  in the plugin-list seat `plugins.item`. The view-aware card is now registered there
  (`id: 'dsh-subscriptions'`, order 60, static label); the row seat and the legacy
  `settings.plugin.item` card stay as fallbacks.

## 0.6.14

### Fixed
- **Settings reachable again**: the card registered into `settings.plugin.item`, a
  slot the current DSH core (0.1.6-alpha.2) no longer renders, so the plugin's
  settings were unreachable. The surface now registers into the Plugins page row
  seat `plugins.row.config`, keyed
  `@goodandready/dsh-subscriptions#dsh-subscriptions`
  (`rowConfigKey(package, rowId)`): the plugin's row gains a configure control whose
  page is the settings form (`view: 'page'`, open and without our card chrome — the
  host page draws the title, icon, crumb and padding) plus a one-line state for
  `view: 'summary'`. The legacy seat stays registered as a fallback for older cores.
