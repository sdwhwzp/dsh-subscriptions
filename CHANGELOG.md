# Changelog

Notable changes to `@goodandready/dsh-subscriptions`.

## 0.6.16

### Performance & Security Optimization
- **Non-blocking stream initialization (#339)**: `refreshUsage` no longer delays Time To First Chunk (TTFT) by running sequentially before chunks are yielded; it now refreshes asynchronously in the background.
- **Debounced history persistence (#340)**: `HistoryStore` now buffers disk writes with a 1000ms debounce instead of synchronous `writeFileSync` on every completed request.
- **CSRF protection hardening (#341)**: `isTrustedSettingsRequest` now strictly validates `Host` vs `Origin` / `Referer` headers when `sec-fetch-site` is omitted.
- **Smart rotation health weighting (#342)**: `listAccounts` now computes and forwards `healthScore`, re-enabling penalty-aware rotation across account pools.
- **Proxy support for status and smoke checks (#343)**: Background health probes and `/check`, `/smoke` routes now route through the slot's configured `proxyUrl`.
- **GitHub Copilot Device Flow support (#344)**: Connected `deviceStart`, `devicePoll`, and `refresh` to the OAuth route handler, enabling Web UI Copilot authorization.
- **Public exports for forecast and relative time (#345)**: Exported `observeForecast`, `estimateForecast`, and `formatRelativeReset` from root `lib/index.js`.
- **Parallel slot reconciliation (#346)**: Cold-start slot discovery across 160 provider/index combinations now executes in parallel via `Promise.all`.
- **Memory leak prevention (#347)**: Implemented automatic pruning of expired entries in `sessionPins` and reset-credit `challenges`.

## 0.6.15

### Fixed
- **Settings reachable again on the plugin's own page**: the current DSH core
  (0.1.6-alpha.2) renders a plugin's configuration page only for entries registered
  in the plugin-list seat `plugins.item`. The view-aware card is now registered there
  (`id: 'dsh-subscriptions'`, order 60, static label); the row seat and the legacy
  `settings.plugin.item` card stay as fallbacks.

## 0.6.14

### Fixed
- **Settings reachable again**: the card registered into `settings.plugin.item`, a
  slot the current DSH core (0.1.6-alpha.2) no longer renders, so the plugin's
  settings were unreachable. The surface now registers into the Plugins page row
  seat `plugins.row.config`, keyed
  `@goodandready/dsh-subscriptions#dsh-subscriptions`
  (`rowConfigKey(package, rowId)`): the plugin's row gains a configure control whose
  page is the settings form (`view: 'page'`, open and without our card chrome — the
  host page draws the title, icon, crumb and padding) plus a one-line state for
  `view: 'summary'`. The legacy seat stays registered as a fallback for older cores.
